        \item Write clean code:

                \item Consistent style: \emph{Use \texttt{black} or \texttt{flake8}}.
                \item Use readable names.
                \item No notebooks!
            \end{itemize}

    Optional but advised
    \begin{itemize}\itemsep.5em

    Pain points of a benchmark:\\[.2em]

\begin{frame}{How does \Benchopt{} do it?}

\Benchopt{} is a framework to organize and run benchmarks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item one repository per benchmark
    \item one base open source \texttt{Python} CLI to run them
\end{itemize}

\vskip1em
Examples of existing benchmarks:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Resnet18

\begin{frame}{Going further: creating a package}

    If you really want to make your research \emph{reproductible} by other in different contexts, you need to properly package it.\\[2em]

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Documentation: \emph{Sphinx}.
        \item Test on multiple platforms: \emph{Continuous Integration}.
        \item Release on pypi/conda-forge
        \item Talk about it ! :)
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

    Reproducible research needs more than just releasing code:\\[2em]

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clean and Documented.
        \item Reusable.
        \item Extendable.
    \end{itemize}

    \vskip2em
    Use proper tools to make it possible!
    \vskip2em
    Research is also collaborative: don't hesitate to report your issues and give feedback :)
