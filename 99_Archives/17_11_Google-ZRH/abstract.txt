Optimization algorithms for sparse coding can be viewed in the light of the neural network framework. Using this framework, it is possible to design trainable networks which accelerate the resolution of an optimization problem on a given distribution, as it has been shown with the Learned ISTA network, proposed by Gregor & Le Cun (2010).
In this talk, we provide elements explaining why the acceleration is possible in the case of ISTA. We show that the resolution of sparse coding can be accelerated compared to ISTA when the design matrix admits a quasi-diagonal factorization with sparse eigenspaces. The resulting algorithm has the same convergence rate but an improved constant factor. Then we show under which conditions such factorization is possible with high probability for generic Gaussian dictionaries. Finally, we design neural networks which compute this algorithm and show that they are a re-parametrization of LISTA. Thus, the performance of LISTA are at least as good as this algorithm. We conclude by designing adverse examples for our factorization based algorithm and show that LISTA also fails to accelerate on these cases, proving that this mechanism plays a role in LISTA acceleration.
