Abstract: Inverse problems are ubiquitous in observational science such as imaging, neurosciences or astrophysics. They consist in recovering a signal given noisy observations through a measurement operator. To solve such problems, Machine learning approaches have been proposed based on algorithm unrolling. With such techniques, classical optimization algorithms used to solve inverse problems can be seen as differentiable procedure with parameters that can be learned.
In this talk, I will focus on the understudied case where no ground truth is available, ie., the signal itself can never be observed, only its measurememts. First, I will present results that aim at understanding what unrolled algorithms learn when used to solve an optimization problem. Then, I will show how algorithm unrolling can be used in conjonction with dictionaries to learn a data-driven structure on the inverse problem solution.

Short-bio: Thomas Moreau is a researcher at Inria Saclay, in the MIND team. His research interests are centered around machine learning for physiological signals, bi-level optimization and time-series representations, with applications to neural activity recording such as MEG or fMRI. He is also involved in Python open-source projects, mainly around parallel scientific computing and machine-learning algorithm benchmarking.
He obtained a PhD from CMLA, ENS Cachan in 2017 under the supervision of N. Vayatis and L. Oudre on convolutional representations for physiological signals. He was then a post-doctoral researcher in the Parietal team for 18 months, working on unsupervised representation for MEG signals and unrolled optimization.
