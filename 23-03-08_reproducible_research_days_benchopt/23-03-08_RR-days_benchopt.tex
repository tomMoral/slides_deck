    \vskip2em
    Current process in ML to extend results:\\[.2em]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Hard to extend existing code.
        \item Re-code methods and tools to integrate a new method.
        \item Competitors' methods do not work out of the box.
    \end{itemize}
    \vskip1em
    All of this started from scratch by every new method!
    \vskip1em
    Also very cumbersome to add a new dataset, or metric.

\begin{frame}{How does \Benchopt{} do it?}

\Benchopt{} is a framework to organize and run benchmarks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item one repository per benchmark
    \item one base open source \texttt{Python} CLI to run them
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

    Reproducible research needs more than just releasing code:\\[2em]

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clean and Documented.
        \item Reusable.
        \item Extendable.
    \end{itemize}

    \vskip2em
    Use proper tools to make it possible!
    \vskip2em
    Research is also collaborative: don't hesitate to report your issues and give feedback :)
