\begin{frame}{Reproducible research}

    Different goals:\\[.5em]
    \begin{itemize}\itemsep.5em
        \item Reproduce the exact same results?
        \item Run with new parameters with robust results?
        \item Run with a new dataset?
        \item Extend the results with a new method?
        \item Provide tools for other to use?
    \end{itemize}
    \vskip2em
    {\centering \large Does not require the same set of tools!\\[2em]}

\begin{frame}{Reproducing the same results}

    Minimal requirement for a research project:\\[.5em]
    \begin{itemize}\itemsep.5em
        \item Write clean code:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Consistent style: \emph{Use \texttt{black} or \texttt{flake8}}.
                \item Use readable names.
                \item No notebooks!
            \end{itemize}
        \item Document your code: \emph{docstring and \texttt{README.md}.}
        \item Determinist output: \emph{Set a random seed!}
    \end{itemize}
    \vskip2em
    Optional but advised
    \begin{itemize}\itemsep.5em
        \item Document dependencies.
        \item Proper package organization
        \item Add some tests: \emph{Use \texttt{pytest}.}
    \end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Extending the results?}


    These advice makes it easier to reproduce the same results, but we want to extend them!
    \pause
    \vskip2em

    Pain points of a benchmark:\\[.2em]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item competitors' methods do not work out of the box.
        \item re-code methods and tools to integrate a new method.
        \item hard to extend with new settings.
    \end{itemize}
    \vskip1em
    {\centering \large all of this started from scratch by every submission!\\}

    \vskip2em


    \Benchopt{} produces \textbf{open}, \textbf{reproducible}, \textbf{extendable} benchmarks

\begin{frame}{Going further: creating a package}

    If you really want to make your research \emph{reproductible} by other in different contexts, you need to properly package it.\\[2em]

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Documentation: \emph{Sphinx}.
        \item Test on multiple platforms: \emph{Continuous Integration}.
        \item Release on pypi/conda-forge
        \item Talk about it ! :)
    \end{itemize}

    \vskip2em

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

    Reproducible research needs more than just releasing code:\\[2em]

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clean and Documented.
        \item Reusable.
        \item Extendable.
    \end{itemize}

    \vskip2em
    Use proper tools to make it possible!
    \vskip2em
    Research is also collaborative: don't hesitate to report your issues and give feedback :)
